# Roadmap

Things that would be nice to have, roughly sorted by priority:

- WebGL renderer.
- Canvas renderer.
- zIndex.
- Focus and keyboard navigation.
- Solution for rendering shapes (mini SVG `<path>` renderer?).
- Benchmarks, especially for the layout algorithm.
- Animations.
- Custom shaders for views ([#12](https://github.com/tchayen/red-otter/issues/12)).
- New styling:
  - Opacity.
  - Gradients.
  - Outlines.
- Support for OTF files (biggest obstacle right now is that calculating sizes of glyphs in OTF is way harder than it TTF).
