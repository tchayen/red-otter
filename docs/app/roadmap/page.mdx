# Roadmap

Things that would be nice to have, roughly sorted by priority:

### WebGL renderer

WebGL is here to stay and while WebGPU adoption is climbing ([Web3DSurvey](https://web3dsurvey.com/webgpu) reports 56.9% at the time of writing this), current lack of mobile support and Safari implementation make keeping WebGL renderer a must-have.

### Canvas renderer

Although I don't expect it to become popular, providing a Canvas renderer is a nice showcase of lib's flexibility.

### Focus and keyboard navigation

Although full accessibility and screen reader support will remain impossible for a long time, one important aspect of a11y can be implemented already.

### Rendering shapes

Following how I approach the overall design of this library, I want to strike the most reasonable balance between implementation complexity and versatility of the API. I am currently thinking that supporting a mini SVG `<path>` renderer will be sufficiently useful to cover this for a while.

### Benchmarks

It's nice to speak of theoretical benefits, but real numbers backing them up are even better.

### Position `fixed` and `sticky`

Doesn't seem to be particularly hard to implement, but also isn't a high priority.

### Animations

Sooner or later I will need to provide support for animating the UI. There are lots of inspirations to draw from, but finding a solution that fits best the library and goes well together with how rendering is designed might prove to be a challenge.

### Custom shaders for views

Reported in [#12](https://github.com/tchayen/red-otter/issues/12). So far Red Otter is just trying to immitate the browser's UI capabilities, but finally a real differentiating factor might be ability to specify custom fragment shaders that manipulate the `View`s.

### New styling options

**Opacity** – clearly a must-have.

**Gradients** – important to match browsers.

**Outlines** – very useful for hovers and other keyboard-navigation related features.

### OTF file support

So far only TTF files are supported. Is there even any difference between the two? Yes, OTF is a newer format and while its fully backwards compatible with TTF, it also supports new complex features. And as you can guess, implementing complex features in the parser is sometimes non-trivial.
