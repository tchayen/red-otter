# Roadmap

Things that would be nice to have, roughly sorted by priority:

- Lots of small bug fixes that I wish I had done before the release but I ran out of steam.
- zIndex support.
- Focus system for inputs and buttons.
- SDF border radius clipping. Currently it's just rectangle, which means that elements can overflow in the corners.
- Better line height and text support. Currently it works, mostly, but is far from perfect and even making a simple button might require manual vertical padding adjustment to make it look good.
- Ability to style scrollbars.
- Font ligatures support.
- More styling options: `outline`, `boxShadow`, background gradients.
- Image rendering.
- Probably some lifecycle methods for components. `onLayout()` is one that definitely comes to mind.
- Non-SDF font rendering that supports regular font atlases from rasterized fonts.
- Rendering vector shapes. Maybe a mini SVG `<path>` renderer?
- Position `fixed` and `sticky`.
- Animations.
- Custom shaders for views.
- Better OTF file support. Currently the library is only able to parse fonts that follow classic TTF-style declaration of glyphs and their sizes.
