# Getting Started

Due to modular and layered architecture, you can start almost anywhere depending on your needs.

## Setting up the renderer

Depending on which renderer you use, setup code will differ. There is a bit of boilerplate code that is needed, but the idea was to make it as unopinionated as possible since setup of every app is different and this is not meant to be a framework, but a UI library that co-exists with other parts of the app.

<Tabs.Root defaultValue="webgpu">
  <Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Trigger value="webgpu">WebGPU</Tabs.Trigger>
    <Tabs.Trigger value="webgl">WebGL</Tabs.Trigger>
  </Tabs.List>
  <Tabs.Content value="webgpu">

There is a bit of setup involved. This is general WebGPU initialization, so if you are doing something similar that boils down to the same thing – it's great, you can skip this part. That is the whole point on not enforcing anything on you.

```tsx
const settings = {
  sampleCount: 4,
  windowHeight: canvas.clientHeight,
  windowWidth: canvas.clientWidth,
};

canvas.width = canvas.clientWidth;
canvas.height = canvas.clientHeight;

const interTTF = await fetch("/Inter.ttf").then((response) => response.arrayBuffer());

const alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";

const entry = navigator.gpu;
invariant(entry, "WebGPU is not supported in this browser.");

const context = canvas.getContext("webgpu");
invariant(context, "WebGPU is not supported in this browser.");

const adapter = await entry.requestAdapter();
invariant(adapter, "No GPU found on this system.");

const device = await adapter.requestDevice();

context.configure({
  alphaMode: "opaque",
  device: device,
  format: navigator.gpu.getPreferredCanvasFormat(),
});

const lookups = prepareLookups(
  [
    {
      buffer: interTTF,
      name: "Inter",
      ttf: parseTTF(interTTF),
    },
  ],
  {
    alphabet,
    fontSize: 150,
  },
);

const fontAtlas = await renderFontAtlas(lookups, { useSDF: true });

const colorTexture = device.createTexture({
  format: "bgra8unorm",
  label: "color",
  sampleCount: settings.sampleCount,
  size: { height: canvas.height, width: canvas.width },
  usage: GPUTextureUsage.RENDER_ATTACHMENT | GPUTextureUsage.COPY_SRC,
});
const colorTextureView = colorTexture.createView({ label: "color" });

const renderer = new ScrollableRenderer(
  device,
  context,
  colorTextureView,
  settings,
  lookups,
  fontAtlas,
);

// Our code goes here…

function render() {
  // …or here!

  const commandEncoder = device.createCommandEncoder();
  renderer.render(commandEncoder);
  device.queue.submit([commandEncoder.finish()]);
  requestAnimationFrame(render);
}

render();
```

  </Tabs.Content>
  <Tabs.Content value="webgl">

_WebGL renderer is not implemented yet._

  </Tabs.Content>
</Tabs.Root>

## First layer: calling renderer directly

First of all, you can abandon all other library features and just use the renderer as a Canvas API replacement (although limited!).

```tsx
renderer.rectangle(
  new Vec4(1, 0, 1, 1),
  new Vec2(50, 50),
  new Vec2(100, 100),
  new Vec4(10, 10, 10, 10),
  new Vec4(0, 0, 0, 0),
  new Vec4(0, 0, 0, 0),
  new Vec2(0, 0),
  new Vec2(Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY, Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY),
  new Vec4(0, 0, 0, 0),
);
```

This will get us a pink rounded rectangle on the screen.

> [!NOTE]
> You might have noticed that this API is uhm… a bit ugly? What are even those parameters? Well, the thing is, this is the most low-level function there is. It is as 'hot path' as it gets here.
>
> Therefore performance takes precedence over ergonomics and most JS engines will deal better with even a large number of arguments rather than with an options object (citation needed).

But usually this is not what might be useful to us. Therefore let's continue to…

## Second layer: using views

This is the place where layout and user events happens.

**TODO release: provide event-less View and Text implementations so that if someone only cares about styled layout, they can use it that way.**

```tsx
const root = new View({
  style: {
    height: "100%",
    width: "100%",
  },
});

root.add(
  new View({
    style: {
      backgroundColor: "#333",
      height: 100,
      width: 100,
    },
  }),
);

layout(root, lookups, new Vec2(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight));
compose(renderer, root);
paint(renderer, root);
```

## Third layer: TBD

**TODO release: implement this/decide what to do at least.**

```tsx
function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

  return (
    <View style={{ height: "100%", width: "100%" }}>
      <View style={{ backgroundColor: "#333", height: 100, width: 100 }}>
        <Text
          style={{
            fontFamily: "Inter",
            color: "#fff",
            fontSize: 16,
          }}
        >
          {count()}
        </Text>
      </View>
    </View>
  );
}
```
