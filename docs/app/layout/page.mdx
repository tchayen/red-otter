# Layout engine

Layout engine executes 4 pass algorithm:

- Pass 1: Traverse tree in level order and generate the reverse queue.
- Pass 2: Resolve wrapping children. Going bottom-up, level order.
- Pass 3: Resolve flex sizes and assign positions. Going top-down, level order.
- Pass 4: Calculate scroll sizes (actual space used by children versus available component size). Going top-down, level order.
