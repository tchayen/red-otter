# Examples

## Basic rendering

Example of basic rendering that does not use the layout algorithm.

<ExampleBasic />

## Interactive UIs

Text inputs focus on click and can be typed into. Text can be selected either with mouse or with shift + arrow keys (or cmd/ctrl to jump to either end).

Scrollable views can be scrolled with mouse wheel or by dragging the scrollbars with mouse.

If anything doesn't work or you find a bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/tchayen/red-otter/issues/new) (but please do check if it hasn't already been reported).

<ExamplePicker />

## Scrollbars

Example (and a benchmark of sorts) of proper scrolling capabilities in the library â€“ nested scrollable views.
