<Blogpost title="0.1: the Big reset" date="2023-12-20" author="Tomasz Czajecki" />

After many months of hard work in the shadows, I am proud to present the next big release of Red Otter. It features:

## New fast WebGPU renderer

More about the approach: [Thousands of Styled Rectangles in 120FPS on GPU](https://tchayen.com/thousands-styled-rectangles-in-120fps-on-gpu).

## Layout improvements

Major improvements to the layout engine:

- Missing CSS properties like `flexWrap`, `flexShrink`, `flexGrow`, `flexBasis`, `minWidth`, `minHeight`, `overflow`.
- Refactored algorithm that shortened the code and packed much more features.

## Text improvements

Kerning, line wrapping, text align.

You can see more about kerning in my recent blogpost: [Drawing Text in WebGPU Using Just the Font File](https://tchayen.com/drawing-text-in-webgpu-using-just-the-font-file).

## Event system

Supports clicks, scrolling, typing.

## Scrolling

Ability to scroll overflowing components. Nested scrolling is not an issue too.

## Tests

Layout tests (hard to believe I got that far without writing proper tests).

## Component library

Base component library with fully functioning browser-like `Input` component.

## New docs

A new documentation website with multiple pages, functioning search, and a blog (that you are reading now!).

## Better CI and release process

Process improvements like automated releases (expect more frequent changes now).
