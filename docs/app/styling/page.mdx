Everything to know about styling components.

## Edge cases

Some differences (or unobvious cases) from RN and/or CSS:

- Default `flexDirection` is `column` (CSS default is `row`).
- Default `alignContent` is `flex-start` (CSS default is `stretch`).
- Default `flexShrink` is `0` (CSS default is `1`).
- `flexBasis` takes precedence over `width` and `height` if defined.
- There's no `margin: auto`.
- Similarly to CSS and RN, if both top and bottom (or left and right) are defined and `height` (or `width`) is _not_ defined, the element will span the distance between those two edges.
- Properties with higher specificity override properties with lower specificity (in CSS it is the that order matters).
  In CSS `style="flex-grow: 1; flex: 2"` would use value `2` for `flex-grow` because it is defined later. Here corresponding code would use value `1` for `flex-grow` because it is more specific. Same goes for `margin`, `padding`, `borderWidth`, `gap`.
- `box-sizing` is always `border-box`, which means that `width` and `height` include both `padding` and `border` (CSS default is `content-box`).

## Colors

Colors are defined as strings, similar to CSS.

Supported formats are hex (long and short variants â€“ `#f00` and `#ff0000`), RGB, RGBA (`rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)`), HSL (`hsl(60 100% 50%)`, `hsl(60, 100%, 50%, 0.8)`), HSLA, HSV.

RGB and HSV require adding A in the end to support alpha. In HSL it is optional. If color is not recognized, `transparent` is used and warning is logged to the console. For the most up-to-date info check `parseColor()` in the code.
