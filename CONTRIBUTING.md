It's still early stage and there are some fundamental decisions to be made in which I probably don't expect much external input.

However, the surface of the library is expanding so there's a lot of things to optimize and improve. See potential to make some function faster? Feel free to open an issue or even a PR.

See some bigger problem that can't be solved easily without trade-offs? Please open an issue.

See a bug? Please open an issue, I really appreciate it.
